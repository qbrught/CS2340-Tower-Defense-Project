1.) HealthBarFollowsEnemyTest():
- Tests that the health bar correctly follows the enemy on the gamescreen
- Relevant to the current milestone because in order to visualize combat, the health bar must follow the correct enemy.

2.) HealthTextChangesValue():
-Tests that the health text correctly changes value as the enemy health changes
-Relevant to the current milestone because the health bar/text has to accurately reflect the enemies health to properly show combat system and projectile effect.

5.) MoveableGameObjectTranslationTest():
-Tests that the translate method in MoveableGameObject causes objects to move
-Relevant to the current milestone because this method is responsible for movement of GameObjects

6.) MoveableGameObjectTranslationSpeedTest():
-Tests that the speed parameter of the translate method causes the movement of gameobjects by that distance
-Relevant to the current milestone because this allows us to offload more calculations to this method instead of calculating the exact destination location of a translation
