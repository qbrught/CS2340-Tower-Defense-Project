1.) enemyCollisionTest:
- Tests the enemies ability to collide with other objects.
- Relevant to the current milestone because it allows us to know if the enemy is overlapping with something.

2.) enemyDisappearAtMonumentTest
- Tests the enemies health decreasing to 0 so that it may disappear once the monument has been reached.
- Relevant to the current milestone because we must be able to decrease the decrease the health of the enemy once it has reached the monument.

3.) testEnemyDifferentSpeeds
- Tests that the enemy would not have different speeds across multiple difficulties (that is a invariance)
- Ensures that the enemy has the appropriate speed based on the subclass instance that was spawned

4.) testGameMap
- Tests that the map coordinates of the path aligns with the ones we expect it to generate
- Fixed generation of map on default seed
